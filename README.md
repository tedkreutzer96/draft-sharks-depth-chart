## Task
Senior Frontend Developer Technical Task
Goal:
Recreate and improve the following page from our site: https://www.draftsharks.com/depth-chart. Your task is to update the page with a mobile-friendly, responsive design and layout. You have the freedom to introduce your own design ideas or follow the existing design closely. In addition to the redesign, you will also need to add new filters and sorting features to enhance the page’s functionality.
Task Concept
Rebuild a page from our site, enhancing the responsiveness and mobile design while adding additional features. You may either follow the existing layout closely or introduce your own design improvements.
Core Features
Mobile-Friendly, Responsive Layout
Ensure the page is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Pay particular attention to how the layout changes across devices. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout adjustments.
Position Filters
Add filters to allow users to filter players by position (e.g., QB, RB, etc.).
Offense vs Defense Filter
Implement an additional filter to toggle between offensive and defensive players.
Sorting for Each Section
Provide the ability to independently sort positional players on the page in ascending and descending order.
Each section should have its own sorting mechanism, ensuring that sorting in one section doesn’t affect others.
Guidelines
Vue.js:
Use Vue.js via CDN (no build tools) to handle interactivity and DOM updates.
Modularize your code using components where appropriate.
CSS:
Use plain CSS for this exercise (no frameworks like Bootstrap). Ensure that the page layout is clean and responsive, adapting well to different screen sizes.
Design Freedom:
You are free to showcase your own design for the page, but feel free to follow the current design on the site if you prefer.
Accessibility:
Ensure basic accessibility practices are followed (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, focus states).
Time Limit:
Aim to complete the task within 2-3 hours.
Optional Bonus (Only if Time Permits)
Hover and Click Effects:
Introduce hover or click effects to improve user experience, such as expanding content, tooltips, or animations.
Dark Mode:
Add a toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
Evaluation Criteria
Code Quality:
Clean, organized, and well-structured code using Vue.js effectively (handling state, methods, etc.).
CSS and Design:
Demonstrate strong understanding of responsive design and modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid) without relying on external libraries.
Functionality:
Filters and sorting must work as expected, with clear separation of functionality across sections.
Design Sensibility:
Whether you choose your own design or stick to the original, show attention to detail in your layout and styling choices.
Bonus:
Any extra features like animations, hover effects, or dark mode are nice to have but not required.

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
